 *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Instances
 * 
 * The M1 layer. Until now this model described types and had no way to express
 * an instance of one, which made "metacircular by construction" true at M2 and
 * useless at M1: a vocabulary could say that Measure is a Class and had nowhere
 * to put the measures.
 * 
 * PURELY REFLECTIVE, which is the whole difference from EObject. There is no
 * generated interface per Class, no implementation class, no factory. An Object
 * knows its type by reference and answers about itself through six operations.
 * That is what makes it portable: a browser gets instances without a code
 * generator, and an agent gets an interaction surface it can be taught in a
 * paragraph.
 * 
 * IMPLEMENTED BY PROJECTING TO ECORE. This model already generates a dynamic
 * EPackage, so the obvious runtime is dynamic EMF instances behind this
 * interface: EMF does resources, serialization, change recording and proxy
 * resolution, and callers see six operations instead of thirty. The cost to
 * watch is a wrapper per object on a large model, so the Ecore-backed
 * implementation should be an adapter cached per instance, or dynamic EMF should
 * implement this interface directly.
 * 
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and the rule that keeps it absent: an operation
 * belongs here only if a consumer cannot compute it from the others plus the
 * type WITHOUT LOADING DATA IT DID NOT ASK FOR. Contents are derivable from the
 * type's containment references plus get, so there is no contents operation, and
 * a caller wanting contents wants the data anyway. Adapters, notification and
 * change recording belong to an implementation, not to this surface. Proxy
 * resolution is discussed on the resolved operation below and is the one place
 * this surface deliberately hides something real.
 * 
 * The second clause of that rule is load bearing and was added late. It is what
 * admits size and indexed get, and it is narrow on purpose: "this would be
 * faster as a primitive" is not a reason, "this cannot be answered without
 * fetching a thousand objects to count them" is.
